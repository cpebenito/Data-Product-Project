## About this App: 



The data in this app came from the R dataset('mtcars'). With this app, the user can see a graphical info of the cars included in the dataset compiled by Motor Trend Cars back in 1974. 

1. The graph can be accessed by selecting one of the parameters in the dropdown window. 

2. Also included in this app, is an option to check which of these cars has the best MPG based on the number of cylinders. 

3. Check this [link](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) for more information about the dataset.



Please check it out and hope it would show the user how with just a few commands, one can produce a really cool application using Shiny. 



Thanks for checking.

## Let's view the dataset

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(mtcars)

```

---

## Structure of Dataset(mtcars)

```{r, echo=FALSE  }

data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)

```

---

## Slide for App

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(shiny)
library(dplyr)
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

cars <- mutate(mtcars, model = rownames(mtcars))
#cars <- rename(cars, cylinders = cyl, displacement = disp, horsepower = hp, weight = wt)

#install.packages('stringr')
#devtools::install_github('muschellij2/slidify')

#install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')
#install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv')

library(slidify)
library(slidifyLibraries)
```
